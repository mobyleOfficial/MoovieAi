# Feature Architecture

Features live under `features/`. UI modules live under `ui/`. Both are container directories — NOT packages. Only the sub-modules inside them are packages.

## Feature Module Structure

Each feature is a package that contains two sub-packages: `domain` and `data`.

```
features/<feature_name>/
  pubspec.yaml                          # Depends on <feature>_domain and <feature>_data
  lib/
    <feature_name>.dart                 # Barrel file re-exporting domain and data
  domain/
    pubspec.yaml                        # Package: <feature>_domain (no external deps)
    lib/
      domain.dart                       # Barrel file
      models/                           # Business entities (pure Dart classes)
        models.dart
      repositories/                     # Repository contracts (abstract classes)
        repositories.dart
      usecases/                         # One use case per file, one public `call` method
        usecases.dart
  data/
    pubspec.yaml                        # Package: <feature>_data (depends on <feature>_domain)
    lib/
      data.dart                         # Barrel file
      models/                           # Data models (fromJson/toJson, maps to domain models)
        models.dart
      repositories/                     # Repository implementations
        repositories.dart
      datasources/                      # Remote and local data sources
        datasources.dart
```

## Dependency Direction

```
feature ──> data ──> domain
       └──────────> domain
```

- `domain` has zero external dependencies — pure Dart only.
- `data` depends on `domain` to implement its contracts.
- The feature barrel package depends on both and re-exports them.
- The main app depends on the feature package.

## Rules

- Each feature is its own package with its own `pubspec.yaml`.
- `domain` and `data` are sub-packages at the feature's root (siblings of `lib/`).
- Package naming: `<feature>` for the feature, `<feature>_domain` and `<feature>_data` for sub-modules.
- The main app adds the feature as a path dependency (e.g., `movies: path: features/movies`).
- Every directory has a barrel file that re-exports its contents.
- Never import from another feature's `data/` layer directly — use the `domain/` layer as the contract boundary.
- One class per file. File names use `snake_case`.

## Dependency Injection Registration

When creating a new feature module, you **must** complete all DI registration steps:

1. **Create the DI module** in `lib/di/<feature>_module.dart` — register the data source, repository, and all use cases using `@module`, `@lazySingleton`, and `@injectable`.
2. **Update `lib/di/injection.config.dart`** — this is generated code, but since `build_runner` may not be available, manually add:
   - The import for the new DI module and feature package.
   - Instantiate the module in the `init()` method.
   - Register all dependencies (`gh.lazySingleton` / `gh.factory`) in the correct order (data source → repository → use cases).
   - Add the `_$<ModuleName>` class at the bottom of the file.
3. **Add the feature package** as a path dependency in the main app's `pubspec.yaml`.
4. **Add domain/data packages** as path dependencies in the UI module's `pubspec.yaml` if the UI consumes them directly.

Skipping any of these steps will cause a `GetIt: Object/factory not registered` runtime error.

## Error Handling & Result Mapping

- **Data sources own `Result` mapping** — all try/catch logic that converts exceptions into `Result<T>` must live in the data source layer, not the repository.
- Remote data sources use `HttpClient`, which wraps HTTP calls in `Result<T>` automatically.
- Local data sources use `LocalClient`, which wraps local storage operations in `Result<T>` automatically via `execute()` and `watch()`.
- **Repositories must never try/catch** — they delegate to data sources and receive already-wrapped `Result<T>` values. Repositories only transform data (e.g., `.toDomain()` mapping), never handle errors.
