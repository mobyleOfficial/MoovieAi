# Blocks `git commit` and `git push` (in the meta-repo) when an operation
# actually involves a submodule that contains AI-tooling files. Enforces
# rules/AI_AGNOSTIC_SUBMODULES.md.
#
# Scoping: do not block every unrelated meta-repo commit. Only block if:
#   - the staged change set or the operation's pathspec includes
#     any configured submodule, AND
#   - that submodule's TRACKED files include any AI-tooling path.
#
# Why tracked-only: a leftover .claude/ in a submodule working tree that
# isn't committed is not a rule violation — submodules must be AI-agnostic
# in their git history, not on every contributor's disk.
